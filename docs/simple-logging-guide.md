# Simple Crawler Logging Enhancement

## What This Does

1. **Creates timestamped log files** in `crawlerlogs/` directory
2. **Reduces terminal noise** by setting external libraries to WARNING level
3. **Keeps existing logging** - no changes to current code needed

## Usage

```python
from app.crawler.simple_logging import setup_crawler_logging

# Call this once at the start of your crawl
log_file = setup_crawler_logging()
print(f"Logs will be saved to: {log_file}")
```

## Files Created

- `crawlerlogs/crawler_20241018_143022.log` - Timestamped debug log with all details
- Terminal output remains clean and focused

## Benefits

- **Debug files** with full details for troubleshooting
- **Clean terminal** output for monitoring progress
- **No code changes** required to existing crawler
- **Quality tracking** preserved through existing logging

That's it! Simple and effective.
