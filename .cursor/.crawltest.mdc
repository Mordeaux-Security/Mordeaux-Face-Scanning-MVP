After changes to crawler functionality run a "STANDARD TEST": make crawl URL=https://www.pornhub.com MAX_TOTAL_IMAGES=20 CRAWL_MODE=site MAX_PAGES=3 MAX_CONCURRENT_IMAGES=10 BATCH_SIZE=25

Make explicit note of images processed per second
# of images processed
# of raw images saved
# of thumbnails saved

images processed per second of <0.4 is unacceptable

Almost every crawl should result in some thumbnails being saved.
0 Thumbnials saved should be scrutinized heavily before making any justification.
